title: Implementing RSA
---

I just finished reading [Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) and what I assume most software engineers do after reading this book is wish that they were an expert in cryptography.

The most ubiquitous form of cryptography that we use day in day out is the RSA key. In fact this post that you are currently reading has been encrypted and decrypted using RSA to during it's journey from my keyboard to GitHub.
