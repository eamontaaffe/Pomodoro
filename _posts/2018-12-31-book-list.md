This year I decided to spend a lot more time reading as a form of leisure. I usually only read non-fiction books, but because I wanted to enjoy reading as a replacement for TV I shifted my selection to include a lot more fiction.


- [Boy]() by Roald Dahl
- [Going Solo]() by Roald Dahl
- [Sleeping Giants]() by Sylvain Neuvel
- [Norse Mythology]() by Neil Gaiman
- [Let My People Go Surfing]() by Yvon Chouinard
- [The Call of the Wild]() by Jack London
- [Barbarian Days]() by William Finnegan
- [Catcher in the Rye]() by J.D. Salinger
- [The Buddha Walks Into a Bar]() by Lodro Rinsler
- [Animal Farm]() by George Orwell
- [The Atlantis Plague]() by A. G. Riddle
- [The Everything Store]() by Brad Stone
- [Crazy Rich Asians]() by Kevin Kwan
- [Snow Crash]() by Neal Stephenson


As someone who never really read a lot when I was younger, I am quite proud of the number of books that I finished this year (although there were a lot of other books that I started and did not finish). I can say without a doubt that it is the largest number of books I have ever read in a year.
