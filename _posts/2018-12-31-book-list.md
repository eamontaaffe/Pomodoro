This year I decided to spend a lot more time reading as a form of leisure. I usually only read non-fiction books, but because I wanted to enjoy reading as a replacement for TV I shifted my selection to include a lot more fiction.

As someone who never really read a lot when I was younger, I am quite proud of the number of books that I finished this year (although there were a lot of other books that I started and did not finish). I can say without a doubt that it is the largest number of books I have ever read in a year.
